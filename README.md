# odin-recipes
This project will test what I have learned in HTML so far. The website will have a main index page, and links to a few recipes. I hope to be able to finish this project with minimal outside help, and prove to myself that I can make this on my own.

I was able to complete this with little to no help. I had a blast working on my first project.

Thanks Odin!
